#-------------------------------------------

The files in this folder demonstrate how to import self-created modules.

- For files "hello.py" and "project.py" the import keyword was used from the first module in the second module.
- When importing a module, all of the code executes, which can be inconvenient. 
- "if __name__ == "__main__": at the beginning of module1, prevents it from running in module2
