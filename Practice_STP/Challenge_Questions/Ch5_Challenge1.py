#2. Create a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the longitude and latitude of somewhere you've lived or visited.

#3. Create a dictionary that contains different attributes about you: height, favorite color, favorite author, etc.

#4. Write a program that lets the user ask your height, favorite color, or favorite author, and returns the result from the dictionary you created in the previous challenge. 

#5. Create a dictionary mapping your favorite musicians to a list of your favorite songs by them.

#6. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are just a few of the containers built into Python. Research Python sets (a type of container). When would you use a set?
